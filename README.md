# jquery-rails

jQuery! For Rails! So great.

This gem provides:

  * jQuery 1, 2 and 3
  * the jQuery UJS adapter
  * assert_select_jquery to test jQuery responses in Ruby tests

## Versions

Starting with v2.1, the jquery-rails gem follows these version guidelines
to provide more control over your app's jQuery version from your Gemfile:

```
patch version bump = updates to jquery-ujs, jquery-rails, and patch-level updates to jQuery
minor version bump = minor-level updates to jQuery
major version bump = major-level updates to jQuery and updates to Rails which may be backwards-incompatible
```

See [VERSIONS.md](VERSIONS.md) to see which versions of jquery-rails bundle which
versions of jQuery.

## Installation

Add
```
gem 'jquery-rails'
```
to your Gemfile.

### Rails 5.1 and before
The jquery and jquery-ujs files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. If they're not already in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` by default, add these lines:

```js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
```

If you are running Rails 5.1, and if you have included `//= require rails-ujs`, then `jquery_ujs` is not needed anymore. You can just add:

```js
//= require jquery
```

If you want to use jQuery 2, you can require `jquery2` instead:

```js
//= require jquery2
//= require jquery_ujs
```

And if you want to use jQuery 3, you can require `jquery3`:

```js
//= require jquery3
//= require jquery_ujs
```


For jQuery UI, we recommend the [jquery-ui-rails](https://github.com/joliss/jquery-ui-rails) gem, as it includes the jquery-ui css and allows easier customization.

*As of v3.0, jquery-rails no longer includes jQuery UI. Use the
jquery-ui-rails gem above.*

### Rails 5.2
(TODO: document this)

### Rails 6.0 + 6.1 With Webpacker

Install the gem as described above. Then run `yarn add jquery`. (to verify jquery is installed or not, check `package.json` and `yarn.lock`)

Then add this code to `config/webpack/environment.js`

```
const webpack = require('webpack')
environment.plugins.prepend('Provide',
  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
    $: 'jquery/src/jquery',
    jQuery: 'jquery/src/jquery'
  })
)
```
(note this must come after the default line generated by Rails, which is `const { environment } = require('@rails/webpacker')`)



Then add this line to `app/javacsripts/packs/application.js` (or to any pack where you need jQuery)
```
require('jquery')
```


# Troubleshooeting

Note that newers browsers implement an object that is also `$`, so if you haven't installed jQuery correctly you will get the native HTML `$` object instead of jQuery. 

The correct one looks like this:

(at your Chrome debugging console)
```
$
ƒ jQuery(selector, context) {
    // The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced'
    // Need init if jQuery is called (just allow error to be thrown if not included)
    return n…
```

The *incorrect* one (the one that is the native browser's and NOT JQUERY), looks like this:

(at your Chrome debugging console)
```
$
ƒ $(selector, [startNode]) { [Command Line API] }
```

If you are not getting jQuery at the debugging console, you haven't installed jQuery correctly
